<p><strong>SERVICES AVAILABILITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Each Partner has a prescribed delivery area. This delivery area may change at any time due to factors such as traffic, weather, or demand on our services. This is to ensure that Items reach your door at their best. Our Partners each decide their own operating hours. That means that the availability of our Services, and the range of Partners from which you can order, depends on the Partners themselves. If you try to order a delivery to a location outside the delivery area or operating hours of a Partner, or the Services are otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible. If you order with a pick-up option, you will be responsible to pick it up yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ORDERS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you place an order through our Services, it needs to be accepted by us or our Partner before it is confirmed. We will send you either a notification or an email (or both) on behalf of the Partner if your order has been accepted (the&nbsp;<strong>"Confirmation Notice</strong><strong>&rdquo;</strong>). The contract for the supply of any Product you order through our Services will be between you and the Partner, and will only be formed when you have been sent a Confirmation Notice by us. You are responsible for paying for all Products ordered using your account, and for related delivery charges, and for complying with these Terms and Conditions, even if you have ordered the Item for someone else. There may be a minimum value applicable before you can receive our Third-party delivery service. This will be displayed on our Services. All Products are subject to availability. In the case of food Products, Partners may use nuts or other allergens in the preparation of certain Products. Please contact our Partner prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Or cannot guarantee that any of the Products sold by our Partners are free of allergens. Please ensure that you have given us a correct email address and phone number as this is how we will communicate with you about your Order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also ensure that you provide an accurate address to ensure that your order arrives to the correct location. If you do not open the door or respond to telephonic correspondence within 5 minutes of our delivery drivers physically reaching your address, we reserve the right to leave the premises, and you will be charged for the Product. Or seeks to provide a quality Services and will be the first contact in the event if there is a problem with your order. We do monitor our Partners very closely and it is of utmost importance to us that they comply with our standards and help us maintain our reputation. Please let us know if you have any comments relating to our Partner or in respect of the orders by emailing or calling our Customer Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CANCELLATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You may cancel an order without charge within a reasonable time and before the Store Partner has started preparing the order (a &ldquo;<strong>Started Order&rdquo;</strong>). Clients can cancel an order before it becomes a <strong>Started Order</strong>, by contacting the Partner or our customer service via our Services immediately. OR alone will determine wether an order is a Started Order or not. If the order was not a Started Order, we will refund your payment (excluding any discount, or Voucher that was applied to the order - see Voucher and Account Credit Terms for more detail). If you cancel any order after it becomes a Started Order, you will be charged the full amount of the price for the Products, and if the driver has been dispatched you will also be charged for delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While every effort is made to ensure that accurate pricing and descriptions are maintained, we reserve the right to cancel any order that is based on inaccurate information. OR and the Partner may also reserve the right to notify you that an order has been cancelled at any time, before or after acceptance, with the reason of cancellation. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled by us or the Partner in accordance with this clause. Any payment made prior to an order being cancelled by OR or a Partner will usually be reimbursed using the same method you used to pay for your order. We may also apply credit to your account to reflect the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS IF SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOUR ITEMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You have a legal right to receive goods which comply with their description, which are of satisfactory quality and which comply with any specific requirements you tell us about (and we agree to) before you place your order. If you believe that the Products you have been delivered do not comply with these legal rights, please let us know. We may request a photograph showing the problem if it is something that can be seen by inspecting the Product. We will provide a refund or account credit in respect of the affected part of the Product, and also in respect of delivery if the whole order was affected, unless we have reasonable cause to believe that the problem was caused after delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to processing your refund or account credit, we may take into account relevant factors including the details of the order, including your account history, what happened on delivery and information from the Partner.</p>
